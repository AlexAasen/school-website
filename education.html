                  I'm currently in the process of learning java development at C3L vocational
									university. So far we've covered topics like the basics of java,
									advanced java, android development, computer storage, unit tests, technologies of
									the web and more. A course lasts a few weeks and tests
									your ability to learn at a quick pace and to then implement what you've learned
									in projects that round up each course.

								<p class="mixedpadding">
                  My time at Uppsala university was spent creating games. Each project consisted
									of 2-3 graphics students pairing up with 2-3 programmers to create something fun.
									The time spent with each project taught me the importance of each member in a team,
									and how important it is for me as an individual to be effective in my work
									and to never miss a deadline. It also made me more flexible as a developer
									as you often found yourself in situations where you had to rethink your
									entire game. Either because the game wasn't fun to play or because the team
									ended up not having enough experience to implement certain features.
                </p>
								<p class="mixedpadding">
									I wrote my thesis on inclusive design, how to design a strong, interesting
									female character and how to avoid hypersexualization.
